## Project Overview

App Template is a modern full-stack application template that provides a solid foundation for building web and mobile applications with user authentication, profile management, and role-based access control.

## Core User Personas

### 1. **Standard User** (Web + Mobile)

**Role**: General application user
**Primary Device**: Web browser or mobile app
**Key Needs**: Access to application features and personal profile management

**User Journey:**
- **Registration**: Create account with email and password
- **Email Verification**: Verify email address to activate account
- **Profile Setup**: Complete profile with name and optional profile photo
- **Daily Usage**: Access application features based on user permissions
- **Profile Management**: Update personal information and settings

### 2. **Manager** (Web + Mobile)

**Role**: Application manager with elevated permissions
**Primary Device**: Web dashboard with mobile access
**Key Needs**: User management and oversight capabilities

**Manager Journey:**
- **User Oversight**: View and manage user accounts
- **Role Management**: Assign and modify user roles
- **Monitoring**: Track user activity and system usage
- **Administration**: Handle user-related tasks and approvals

### 3. **Super Admin** (Web Dashboard)

**Role**: Platform administrator with full system access
**Primary Device**: Web dashboard
**Key Needs**: Complete platform control and system administration

**Admin Journey:**
- **System Administration**: Full platform management capabilities
- **User Management**: Create, modify, and manage all user accounts
- **Platform Oversight**: Monitor system health and performance
- **Configuration**: Manage application settings and configurations

## User Story Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New User Registration

**Characters**: New User (Sarah), Manager (John), Super Admin (Alex)

1. **Sarah** visits the application and clicks "Sign Up"
2. Enters email, password, and basic information
3. Receives email verification link
4. Clicks verification link to activate account
5. **John** (if applicable) reviews new user registration
6. **Sarah** completes profile setup with additional information

### Scenario 2: User Profile Management

1. **Sarah** logs into the application
2. Navigates to profile settings
3. Updates personal information (name, profile photo)
4. Changes password for security
5. Manages notification preferences

### Scenario 3: Password Reset Flow

1. **Sarah** forgets password and clicks "Forgot Password"
2. Enters email address
3. Receives password reset email
4. Clicks reset link and creates new password
5. Successfully logs in with new credentials

### Scenario 4: Role-Based Access

1. **John** (Manager) logs in and accesses manager dashboard
2. Views user management features unavailable to standard users
3. **Alex** (Super Admin) accesses advanced system administration
4. Manages user roles and system settings
